Default notations by country
============================

This is a table of the standard notation for each country for phone number.
When writing phone numbers out, use this format.  This is not exhaustive; phone
numbers sometimes come in several formats, and you should look at the file for a
given country before trying to parse mixed data.

| Country       | Notation         | Example #        | Regex |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| Canada        | 1 (111) 111-1111 | 1 (919) 555-0199 | todo  |
| United States | 1 (111) 111-1111 | 1 (647) 555-0199 | todo  |
